## Block Compression Models
Block compression models are a collection of various compression algorithms for the compressing of 3D blocks, the algorithms includes Dynamic Programming Compression, 3D decomposition compression, orctree and etc. 

Please checkout the wiki page for the description and the implementations for each algorithm:

- [Dynamic Programming Compression](https://github.com/arctorious/Block-Model-Compression/wiki/Dynamic-Programming)
  
- [Octree Compression](https://github.com/arctorious/Block-Model-Compression/wiki/Octree-compression)

## Build

To build for **Linux** system executable:

```
make
```

## Test

To see the output with the given cvs file:

```
make run
```

To time your solution:

```
make time
```

## Build for Windows

To cross-compile from **Linux** to **Windows**:

```
make titan-linux
```

## Run semi-titan locally

To run the given py script with the created `.exe` open command prompt or powershell inside */build* folder

If you are in `wsl` directories you can use the following command and copy the build folder.

```
explorer.exe .
```

Run the test using:

```
python runner.py BLOCK11.exe the_intro_one_32768_4x4x4.csv [-r [RUNTIME]] [-s] [-v]
```


1. **-r, --runtime**: This flag specifies a minimum runtime in seconds that is used with the -s flag to improve accuracy. It can help ensure that the item under test runs for a minimum duration, allowing for more precise speed measurements. If the flag is used without specifying a value, the default is 60 seconds. If the flag is not used at all, the default value is 1000000.

2. **-s, --speed**: When this flag is present, the script will output the speed of the item under test in addition to the compression. The speed is measured relative to a reference implementation, and the output will include a floating-point number that represents the speed. Higher values are better, with 2.0 meaning twice as fast as the reference, 0.2 meaning five times slower, etc.

3. **-v, --verbose**: This flag, when present, enables more verbose output. It prints additional details and progress information to the standard error output, allowing you to see what the script is doing as it executes.
